# DemandWise: Intelligent Demand Forecasting

DemandWise is an application designed to provide accurate and insightful demand forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. With this tool, users can input historical demand data for a product and receive forecasts for future demand trends.

## Features

- **ARIMA Modeling**: Utilizes the ARIMA algorithm to generate demand forecasts based on historical data.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides interactive visualizations of both historical and forecasted demand trends.
- **Data Storage**: Stores forecasted demand data along with corresponding graphs in a MongoDB database for future reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive interface for users to input data and initiate demand forecasting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, pymongo, customtkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hrishikesh19032004/DemandForecasting.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels pymongo customtkinter
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python demandwise.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Input the product name, historical demand data (comma-separated), and the number of forecast steps.
3. Click on "Start Forecasting" to initiate the demand forecasting process.
4. View the generated forecast along with the interactive visualization.
5. Optionally, click on "Show Line Graph" to view a line plot of the forecasted demand.
